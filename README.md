**Abstract**

  The goal of this project is to employ machine learning to build personalized education
plans for students. Each student will have a tailored learning plan based on their own
learning requirements and interests. This will assist students in learning more successfully
as well as staying motivated and on task. Machine learning models that forecast student
needs and interests will be used to create the roadmap. Data from studentsâ€™ academic
performance, interests, and learning preferences will be used to train the models. The
roadmap will outline which courses each student should take and which resources they
should use. The roadmap will be regularly revised to reflect student growth and changing
needs. The goal of this project is to improve student learning outcomes. It is also projected
to grow.
